Tables in BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form), which means that they meet the following conditions:

The table is in 3NF (Third Normal Form).
Every determinant is a candidate key.
There are no non-trivial functional dependencies between candidate keys.
To verify this, we can analyze each table and its dependencies. Here are the analysis results:

1. Table 'payment_method' has only one attribute, which is the primary key. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
2. Table 'kaspi_payment' has two attributes as its primary key (pay_id and kaspi_id), and no other attributes are dependent on these primary keys. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
3. Table 'cash_payment' has two attributes as its primary key (pay_id and cash_id), and no other attributes are dependent on these primary keys. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
4. Table 'creditcard_payment' has two attributes as its primary key (pay_id and creditcard_id), and no other attributes are dependent on these primary keys. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
5. Table 'client' has only one attribute as its primary key. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
6. Table 'client_address' has two attributes as its primary key (client_address_id and clientID), and no other attributes are dependent on these primary keys. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
7. Table 'client_payment' has three attributes as its primary key (client_payment_id, client_id, and payment_method_id), and no other attributes are dependent on these primary keys. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
8. Table 'department' has only one attribute as its primary key. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
9. Table 'employees' has only one attribute as its primary key (employee_id), and department_id is dependent on this primary key. Since department_id is a candidate key, this table is already in BCNF.
10. Table 'suppliers' has only one attribute as its primary key. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
11. Table 'category' has only one attribute as its primary key. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
12. Table 'products' has two attributes as its primary key (product_id and category_id), and supplier_id is dependent on product_id. Since product_id is a candidate key, this table is already in BCNF.
13. Table 'orders' has only one attribute as its primary key (order_id), and client_id, emp_id, and product_id are dependent on this primary key. Since all of these attributes are candidate keys, this table is already in BCNF.
14. Table 'delivery' has only one attribute as its primary key. Therefore, it is already in BCNF.
15. Table 'order_details' has only one attribute as its primary key (order_details_id), and order_id, payment_id, delivery_id, and client_address_id are dependent on this primary key. Since all of these attributes are candidate keys, this table is already in BCNF.
Therefore, all tables in the given database are already in BCNF.
